# soapboxscience

Soapbox Science is a public engagement event which involves doing computing in the open air without computers

I made two things to help this out: a set of flipbooks (to show video dynamically) and a shadow box which is an arduino powered cardboard box with coloured lights in. 

This repo will hold the python script that makes flipbooks (actually, makes a latex file which will compile to a flipbook given a directory of image files in an appropriate location) and an Arduino file which will power a box of shiny lights (or rather, a neopixel ring).

They're both quite hacky programs but hey feel free to take them and do stuff:)
